Installation instructions
-------------------------
## Using Composer to install dependencies

This is the recommended way to install Akeneo PIM.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

### Clone Akeneo PIM project with:

    $ git clone git@github.com:akeneo/pim-community-dev.git

Now, you can go to your pim project directory.

    $ cd pim-community-dev

### Install Akeneo PIM dependencies with Composer

Due to some limitations of Oro Platform, you **MUST** create your database before launching composer.

    $ php ../composer.phar install

Note that using the "--prefer-dist" option can speed up
the installation by looking into your local Composer cache.

### Add translation packs (optional)

You can download translation packs from crowdin:
- http://crowdin.net/project/akeneo
- http://crowdin.net/project/oro-platform

The Akeneo PIM archive contains the following directories tree: `<locale>/<version>/<translation_directories>`
You just have to paste the <translation_directories> in your app/Resources/ directory.

For Oro Platform, the archive contains the same directories tree except the version directory which is removed.

### Initialize data and assets

    $ php app/console pim:install --env=dev

Note: This script can be executed several times if you need to reinit your db or redeploy your assets.
You just have to use the `--force` option.
By default, this script initializes the dev environment.

### Clear the cache to finalize the installation

    $ php app/console cache:clear --env=dev

Create the Apache Virtual host
------------------------------

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName akeneo-pim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/
    <Directory /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_error.log

    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Do not forget to change the "/path/to/your/pim/installation/web" to the full path to
the web directory inside your Akeneo PIM installation directory.

Now, you just have to add your host to hosts file `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost akeneo-pim.local
```

Write permission for the HTTP server
------------------------------------

You must give write permission to the Apache user on the following directories:
- app/cache
- app/logs
- app/entities
- app/import
- app/export
- app/emails
- web/bundles
- app/uploads/product
- app/archive

Configure crontab
-----------------

To ensure that completeness is as up to date as possible, you can configure the following crontab
line:

    */2 * * * * php app/console pim:completeness:calculate > /tmp/completeness.log

In case you import data without running the versioning system in real time, you can make sure
that versioning is recalculated appropriately with this crontab line (assuming you filled the
version pending table with the adequate information):

    */5 * * * * php app/console pim:versioning:refresh > /tmp/versioning.log

Checking your System Configuration
----------------------------------

Before starting to contribute to Akeneo, make sure that your system is properly
configured for a Symfony application.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    $ php app/console pim:install --force --task=check

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.
